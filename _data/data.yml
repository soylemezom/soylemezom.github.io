projects:
  - title: DevOps Transformation for Optimized E-Commerce Retail Operations
    intro: >
      <p>Developing a CI/CD pipeline to automate software development, testing, packaging, and deployment processes.
      Pushing code to GitHub repository. Creating a Jenkins pipeline for compiling, testing, and packaging code.
      Writing Dockerfiles to deploy the WAR file to the Tomcat server. Integrating Docker with Ansible and writing
      playbooks for deployment. Deploying artifacts to the Kubernetes cluster. Monitoring resources using Grafana.
      By implementing these initiatives, This Technology store aims to transform the acquired business's operations,
      enhancing its competitiveness in the retail market and positioning it for sustained growth and success.</p>

  - title: Deploying a Guest Book Application on IBM Cloud
    intro: >
      <p>This DevOps project aims to deploy a guest book application on IBM Cloud,
      leveraging automation and best practices for efficiency and reliability.
      We set up source control with Git, configure CI pipelines using Jenkins
      to automate build and test processes, and containerize the application with Docker,
      storing images in IBM Cloud Container Registry. Infrastructure provisioning will be
      managed through Terraform, and CD pipelines will deploy the application to
      IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) using Helm charts. Monitoring and logging will be
      implemented with IBM Cloud Monitoring and LogDNA, while security practices and compliance
      checks will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using IBM Cloud Security Advisor.
      This approach ensures automated, scalable, and secure deployments, enhancing the overall
      operational effectiveness of the application.</p>
